# invoice_generator
Yet another tool to track service delivery.

As a freelance I was needed a tool to track my service delivery.
I did not searched for an existing tool and I just jumped forward writing my own.

This is a web application using the folowing components 
- Foundation 6.3 from Zurb.
- foundation-datetimepicker.
- Wickedpicker.
- fullcalendar.
- Flask.
- Weasyprint for PDF generation.

# Setup
1. Install the requirements from requirements.txt.
2. Create the database with the script located in database/db_create.py.
3. Run the script run.py.
